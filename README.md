#### Abstract

Terrorism is nothing new, and open to different interpretation. If you ask me, and any other layperson on the street what that means, you would probably get a response of some foreign negative impact on lives and properties. However, looking at the Las Vegas shooting, which is regarded as the deadliest ever gun attack in the US that killed at least 59 and injured 527 people, then reality sets in. The question now is do we classify such a terrorist attack or not? Is the US imploding from inside out or outside in? Can we tell beforehand where this is coming from and going? These questions are begging answers, and form the core of my analysis. 

This work is based on a real life dataset from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) maintained by the University of Maryland. Its purpose is
to gain insights into current state of terrorism in the US, and possibly making predictions of future unrewarded risks. I foresee this 
analysis valuable to the US Department of Homeland Security, other government establishments, businesses or individuals that care about 
safety of lives and properties. It is also my way of giving back to help save lives.

The analysis will be progressively reviewed based on feedback from industry experts and periodic updates of the GTD. This work is part of my submission as a capstone project at Springboard Data Science Career Track Fellowship Program.
  


#### Statistical Questions and/or Goals ###

* To what accuracy can we predict the group name (gname) of terrorist attackers in the USA?
* Are attacks in the US by US citizens or foreign nationals?
* Can we compare predicition accuracy based on number of classes in a target variable?

Things of notes here are:
1. The original dataset is too large, and cannot be uploaded on here. It can be downloaded from http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ after filling out a form and providing personal information. However, i have an abridged version of the spreadsheet on here restricted to cases in the USA.
2. My approach to this analysis can be applied to the full dataset and/or other countries with minor tweaks. I will be making progressive updates on this analysis and model based on feedback from industry experts and University of Maryland GTD data owners. 
3. I propose more questions being asked of this data as analysis progress.
