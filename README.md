#### Abstract
This work is based on a real life dataset from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) maintained by the University of Maryland. Its purpose is
to gain insights into current state of terrorism in the US, and possibly making predictions of future unrewarded risks. I foresee this 
analysis valuable to the US Department of Homeland Security, other government establishments, businesses or individuals that care about 
safety of lives and properties. It is my way of giving back to an adopted nation, and help save lives


#### Statistical Questions and/or Goals ###

* To what accuracy can we predict the group name (gname) of terrorist attackers in the USA?
* Are attacks in the US inbreed or originating from other countries?
* Can we compare predicition accuracy based on number of classes in a target variable?

Things of notes here are:
1. The original dataset is too large, and cannot be uploaded on here. It can be downloaded from http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ after filling out a form and providing personal information. However, i have an abridged version of the spreadsheet on here restricted to cases in the USA.
2. My approach to this analysis can be applied to the full dataset and/or other countries with minor tweaks. I will be making progressive updates on this analysis and model based on feedback from industry experts and University of Maryland GTD data owners. 
3. I propose more questions being asked of this data as analysis progress.
