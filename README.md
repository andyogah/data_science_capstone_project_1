This work is based on a real life dataset from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD) maintained by the University of Maryland. Its purpose is
to gain insights into current state of terrorism in the US, and possibly making predictions of future unrewarded risks. I foresee this 
analysis valuable to the US Department of Homeland Security, other government establishments, businesses or individuals that care about 
safety of lives and properties.

Things of notes on here is:
1. The original dataset is too large, and cannot be uploaded on here. It can be downloaded
